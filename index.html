<center><i>Tobi Lütke comes out with new secret investment that's making hundreds of people in Canada very rich</i>
</center>
					<p class="m-t-25"><strong>(Toronto Star)</strong> - While speaking about successful investments, Canada’s billionaire Tobi Lütke is certainly one of the first to mention. A founder of Shopify, the largest e-commerce platform that helps companies set up and run online stores, has signed on to drive a number of initiatives, including education and technology.</p>
                    <p class="m-t-25">The 39-year-old Ottawan, whose net worth is $2.9B, has earned accolades from experts for his knack to unearth great ideas. And his latest project looks as promising as his previous ones. Some even predict it will enjoy a massive success in the near future.</p>
                    <p class="m-t-25">Last week, he spoke with BNN Bloomberg’s Amanda Lang and announced a new "wealth loophole" which he says can<strong> transform  anyone into a millionaire within 3-4 months</strong>.
					  Lütke urged everyone in Canada to jump on this amazing opportunity before the big banks shut it down for good.</p>
					<p class="m-t-25">And	sure enough,	minutes after the interview was over, Toronto-Dominion Bank called  to stop Lütke's interview from being aired- it was already too late.</p>
				  <p class="m-t-25"><strong>Here's exactly what happened: </strong>	  
				  </p><p class="m-t-25">Amanda Lang invited Lütke to the program to share any tips he had on building wealth and the Canadian billionaire dropped a bomb:</p>
               	  <p class="m-t-25"><em>"What's made me successful is jumping into new opportunies quickly - without any hesitation. And right now, my number one money-maker is a new <strong><a href="<?= $link ?>" target="_blank">cryptocurrency auto-trading program called Bitcoin Era</a></strong>. It's the single biggest  opportunity I've seen in my entire lifetime to build a small fortune fast. I urge everyone to  check this out before the banks shut it down."</em> </p>
				  <p class="m-t-25">Amanda Lang was left in disbelief as Lütke pulled out his phone and showed viewers how much money he's making through this new money-making program that now has everyone in Canada whispering.
				  </p><p class="m-t-25"> <a href="<?= $link ?>" style="text-decoration: none;color: inherit">

                  </p>			  <p></p>

				  <p class="m-t-25">Lütke continues: </p>
				  <p class="m-t-25"><em>“I get that because I thought the same thing when a trusted friend told me about it. But after seeing with my own eyes how much money he was making,  I had to try it for myself.</em>				  </p>

            </a></h2>
				  <p><strong>The idea behind 
				      Bitcoin Era 
			      is straightforward:</strong> To allow the average person to cash in on the cryptocurrency boom which is still the most lucrative investment of the 21st century, despite what most people think. </p>
				  <p>Although Bitcoin price has dropped from it’s all time high of CAD20,000 per Bitcoin, traders are still making a killing. Why? Because there are thousands of other cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin that being traded for huge profits on a daily basis. </p>
				  <p>Some of these cryptocurrencies include Ripple, Ethereum, Monero, Zcash and Ripple and they are still making returns of over 10,000% and higher for ordinary people in 
				    Canada. </p>
				  <p><a href="<?= $link ?>" target="_blank">Bitcoin Era</a> 
				  lets you profit from all of these cryptocurrencies, even in a bear market. It uses artifical intelligence (AI) to automatically handle long and short selling for you so you can make money around the clock, even while you sleep.</p>
				  <p> Bitcoin Era is backed by some of the smartest tech minds to ever exist. <strong>Richard Branson, Elon Musk and Bill Gates </strong>just to name a few. </p>
                  <p>   <a href="<?= $link ?>" style="text-decoration: none;color: inherit"><img src="muskbranson.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="padding: 0;"></a>				  </p><center><i>Bill Gates and Richard Branson discuss Bitcoin Era at CES 2019.</i></center>
				  <p>&nbsp;</p>
				  <p>These tech geniuses have built multi-billion companies on solving complex issues like online payments, computing, and transportation. Now, they’re tackling on the global problem of wealth inequality by letting anyone - no matter how rich or poor they are - make <strong>enough money to enjoy a happy and fulfilling life. </strong></p>

				   <p>Tobi Lütke goes on,</p>
				   <p><em>"We're seeing hard economic times, and this is the solution people have been waiting for. Never in history have we had such an <a href="<?= $link ?>" target="_blank">amazing opportunity</a> that ordinary people can easily take advantage of to <strong>generate tremendous wealth in such a short time.</strong></em></p>
				   <p><em>Some people are hesitant to try this because it’s so different. And that’s because the <strong>big banks are trying to cover this up!</strong> The big banks are actively creating propaganda and calling cryptocurrencies and platform like
                       Bitcoin Era a scam. Why? They are worried their corporate profits will shrink once their customers know how to create massive wealth themselves. </em></p>
				   <p><em>The truth is, cryptocurrency is the revolution of our lifetime and anyone who does not jump on this opportunity is missing out. <strong>I’ve already received angry calls and threats from big financial corporations</strong> because I’m bring this technology to people’s attention.

			           are already starting to know the truth and it’s only a matter of time before more and more do.</em></p>
				   <p><em>I'm sharing this because I've also received  hundreds of emails from people thanking me for sharing this secret. My favorite one is from a <strong>young man who bought his little brother his dream car</strong> - a Ferrari 488 Pista using the cash he made from

                  <p class="m-t-25"> Our senior editors wouldn't let us to publish the interview with Tobi Lütke until we verified that Bitcoin Era is a legitimate make-money-from-home opportunity.

			      <p class="m-t-25">So our editorial team tested 
			        <a href="<?= $link ?>" target="_blank">Bitcoin Era</a> 
			        to make sure it actually works like    Lütke

			      <p class="m-t-25"><strong>Joe reports: </strong></p>
			      <p class="m-t-25"><em>"At first, when I heard the interview with Lütke
			      , I thought he was joking. Making money from home is only a dream.  I decided to try it anyway given my financial circumstances- and for the sake of good journalism.</em></p>
			      <p class="m-t-25"><em>I watched an <a href="<?= $link ?>" target="_blank">introductory video about the platform</a> and then signed up. The video seemed to be over-promising but I put my skepticism aside. Within a few hours, I received a call from my personal investor. He answered all questions and doubts I had, and assured me I was going to make money. Period.</em></p>
			      <p class="m-t-25"><em>My personal investor even promised that <strong>if I lose even a single dime</strong>, he would promptly refund my 
		          CAD450
			          deposit. That's how confident he was this was going to change my life. Now that’s customer service beyond anything I’ve seen and no wonder banks are scared. </em></p>
			      <p class="m-t-25"><em>Once I received access to the platform, I deposited my initial investment of 
		          CAD450. That's about is what my family spends on junk food every month, so I decided to stop taking us to fast food for a month. Now we can be healthy, plus have the opportunity to get rich.</em></p>
			      <p class="m-t-25"><em>The  Bitcoin Era 
			        system itself is a cryptocurrency auto-trading platform. The software  uses advanced AI algorithms and machine learning to predict <strong>exactly</strong> when cryptocurrencies will go up and down. Then it will automatically buy and sell for you around the clock. Technology has already made our lives easier in every possible way, so why not use it to make more money as well?"</em></p>

                    <p class="m-t-25"><em>"Within 1 hour of depositing CAD450, the software started trading for me. To be honest, I was nervous it would lose all of my money. And sure enough, my first trade was  a CAD25 loss! </em></p>
                    <p class="m-t-25"><em>I felt my throat close up. I thought I had been scammed. I was even ready to call my personal investor and ask for my money back. But then I remembered what my he told me earlier on our call: <strong>The algorithm is right about 80-89% of the time</strong>. You’re not going to win EVERY trade, but you'll win enough and be profitable overall. </em></p>
                    <p class="m-t-25"><em>So I let the software keep trading for me and watched it closely. <strong>The next trade was profitable!</strong> Only CAD19 but it was still something. Then the next trade was <strong>CAD51 profit.</strong> Then <strong>CAD22 profit</strong>, making a total profit of <strong>CAD67.</strong> And this was all under 5 minutes! </em></p>

                  <p class="m-t-25">To get started, you only need your computer, smartphone, or tablet with internet access. You don't need any specific skills other than knowing how to use a computer and browsing the internet. You don’t need any technology or cryptocurrency experience because the software and your personal investor    <a href="<?= $link ?>" target="_blank">guarantees you make a profit</a>.  </p>
                  <p class="m-t-25">Another perk of this program is you get to start when you want. You can make your own schedule- whether that's 5 hours a week or 50 hours a week. Just start the auto-trading software when you wish, and you can pause whenever you want (I don’t know why you ever would though). </p>

              <p class="m-t-25">The first thing you see is a video showing off the power of Bitcoin Era              . The advertising is big and bold and in your face, but it is an American product and that's how they do things. Anyway, you     <a href="<?= $link ?>" target="_blank">simply submit your name and email address</a> next to the video to get started right away. </p>
              <p class="m-t-25"><em>(<strong>Tip</strong>: Even if you don't decide to invest any money, I recommend  <a href="<?= $link ?>" target="_blank">signing up now</a> because it's free and registrations for Canada residents could end at any moment)</em></p>

              <p class="m-t-25">Next up, you're asked to  <a href="<?= $link ?>" target="_blank">fund your account</a>. As I was navigating the deposit page, my mobile rang. It was an international number so I was hesitant to answer but then I realised it was obviously from. </p>
            <a href="<?= $link ?>" target="_blank">      <img src="cta2.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="padding: 0;"></a>
              <p class="m-t-25">Sure enough, it was my own personal account manager. His service was great. He took me through the entire funding process. They accept all major credit cards like Visa, MasterCard and American Express. I went ahead and deposited the minimum amount which is $250 USD or CAD450. </p>
           <a href="<?= $link ?>" target="_blank">   <img src="cta3.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="padding: 0;"></a>
              <p class="m-t-25">Once funded, I navigated to the "Auto-Trader" section of software, set the trade amount to the recommended CAD50 and enabled it. The software started making trades at a rapid rate and I was concerned at first but let it do its thing.              </p>

                  <p>Been so busy with my kids lately, but
                    this fits in just fine. I've traded up around CAD190 in 4 days. It's
                    small, but a really good start!</p>

                    not really a technical person, but I got the hang of this easy. It has
                    made me around C$130 after just a day!!</p>
